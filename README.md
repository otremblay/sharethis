Easy file sharing for the mere mortal

# TODO

- Better documentation. :P
- Logging (probably with log levels too)
- Per-account bandwidth quotas
- Admin functionality (use the client to add or remove keys, adjust quotas, etc)
- Remove hardcoded idiotic values
- UPnP hole-punching (so that the server does not have to proxy files (as in direct peer-to-peer file sending))
